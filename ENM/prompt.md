You are an expert in biodiversity informatics and knowledge graph construction, functioning as a highly accurate, automated information extraction engine. Your task is to process an input containing a DOI and a scientific text. You must extract entities and relationships by deeply understanding the text's semantic meaning and linking it to the specific framework stage definitions provided below.

**TASK:**
1.  The input begins with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Capture this DOI.
2.  Read the scientific text that follows.
3.  For each section of the text, determine which framework stage (as defined in `FRAMEWORK_DEFINITIONS`) it corresponds to.
4.  Extract all entities from the text that precisely match the types in the `ENTITY_SCHEMA`.
5.  Assign a unique integer ID to each extracted entity.
6.  Extract all relationships between entities as defined in `RELATION_SCHEMA`. Crucially, use the `PART_OF_FRAMEWORK` relation to link specific entities (e.g., a data source or an algorithm) to the `ODMAP_Stage` or `Checklist_Stage` they belong to, based on the provided definitions.
7.  Format your entire output as a single JSON object.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Your response **MUST** be a single, raw JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown code blocks (like ```json ... ```). Do not include any explanatory text, introductions, or any other content before or after the JSON object. The output must start with `{` and end with `}`.

**FRAMEWORK_DEFINITIONS:**
These definitions are your primary guide for classifying text content into framework stages.

*   **ODMAP Stages (based on Fitzpatrick et al., 2021):**
    *   **`Overview`**: Corresponds to text describing the study's main objectives, core assumptions, spatial/temporal scale, and a high-level summary of algorithms and software used. This is the general introduction to the modeling approach.
*   **`Data`**: Pertains to all aspects of obtaining and processing input data. This includes sourcing, cleaning, and formatting both species occurrence records and environmental predictor variables.
*   **`Model`**: Focuses on the model fitting and calibration process. This includes the choice of algorithm, the specific parameters used, model settings, and how background data was selected or generated.
*   **`Assessment`**: Relates to the evaluation of model performance. This includes the use of evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, TSS), the data used for testing (e.g., cross-validation partitions), and statistical significance testing.
*   **`Prediction`**: Concerns the application of the calibrated model. This includes projecting the model onto new geographical areas or time periods, and the strategies used for handling extrapolation into novel environments.

*   **Feng et al. Checklist Stages (based on Feng et al., 2019):**
  *   **`Occurrence data collection and processing`**: All details about the species data, including its source (e.g., GBIF), download date/version, basis of record, and methods for cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates, spatial thinning, correcting errors) and addressing sampling bias.
*   **`Environmental data collection and processing`**: All details about environmental predictors, including their source (e.g., WorldClim), version, spatial/temporal resolution, and any processing steps like aggregation or layer selection based on collinearity (e.g., VIF).
*   **`Model calibration`**: The core modeling procedure. This includes defining the study area (modeling domain), selecting background/pseudo-absence points, the final selection of variables used in the model, the name and version of the algorithm, and the specific parameterization (tuning) of the algorithm.
*   **`Model transfer and evaluation`**: The process of evaluating the model's predictive ability and applying it. This includes the evaluation metrics chosen, the method for converting continuous output to binary maps (thresholding), the data partitioning scheme for evaluation (e.g., training/testing split), and strategies for extrapolation.

**ENTITY_SCHEMA:**
*   **`ODMAP_Stage`**: A high-level stage from the ODMAP protocol, as defined above (e.g., `Overview`, `Data`, `Model`, `Assessment`, `Prediction`).
*   **`Checklist_Stage`**: A high-level stage from the Feng et al. (2019) checklist, as defined above (e.g., `Occurrence data collection and processing`, `Model calibration`).
*   **`ModelAlgorithm`**: Specific modeling algorithm name (e.g., Maxent, GLM).
*   **`SoftwareTool`**: Software package, program, or platform (e.g., `dismo`, Wallace).
*   **`Parameter`**: Specific setting or hyperparameter of a model (e.g., Regularization multiplier).
*   **`DataSource`**: Database or institution providing raw data (e.g., GBIF, WorldClim).
*   **`DataType`**: The general category of data (e.g., Occurrence data, Climate data).
*   **`Variable`**: Specific environmental variable used (e.g., BIO1, Elevation).
*   **`DataStandard`**: A formal standard for data formatting (e.g., Darwin Core, RMMS).
*   **`ModelingStep`**: A distinct, specific sub-task within a larger stage (e.g., Data Cleaning, Variable Selection).
*   **`ThresholdingMethod`**: A specific method used to convert continuous model predictions to binary (e.g., Lowest Present Threshold).
*   **`EvaluationMetric`**: A specific metric to quantify model performance (e.g., AUC, TSS).
*   **`ModelProperty`**: An abstract quality of a model (e.g., Reproducibility, Transferability, Uncertainty).
*   **`Concept`**: Core theoretical concepts (e.g., Ecological Niche, Sampling bias).
*   **`Application`**: The practical use-case of a model (e.g., Conservation planning).
*   **`Standard`**: The name of the overall guideline itself (e.g., `ODMAP`, `Feng's Checklist`).
*   **`Researcher`**: An author or cited researcher.
*   **`Publication`**: A cited scientific paper.
*   **`Organization`**: An institution involved in research or standards.

**RELATION_SCHEMA:**
  *   **`PART_OF_FRAMEWORK`**: Links a specific entity instance to the framework stage it belongs to.
