The quality of a seed lot results from the interaction of attributes that determine its overall value for a specific purpose. Seed Science and Technology is a widely recognised journal first published in 1973 as a continuation of the Proceedings of the International Seed Testing Association (1921 to 1972). The Journal publishes original papers and articles comprising different aspects of seed production, processing, storage, testing, genetic conservation, habitat regeneration and reforestation programs, with both basic and applied topics on seed science. Seed quality represents a permanent focus of Seed Science and Technology and the articles published in this issue, with a predominant approach on physiological potential, genetic purity and seed enhancement, confirm this strong commitment The species covered by the articles in this issue represent important worldwide grain, forage and ornamental crops, but there are also species with local value, for environmental restoration and medicinal application.

Conservation efforts addressing the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on movements must rely on operational definitions of land-cover types that are relevant to the behavioral decisions made by the species of interest. Travel costs, and ultimately landscape resistance (or permeability to movement) can be assessed through experiments standardizing the motivation of individuals to move across specific landscape elements, including habitat patches, the matrix, and their edges. So far, most studies modeling landscape permeability based on cost values have focused on habitat-specialist species and characterized landscape composition based on contrasting, human-defined cover types such as forest and open land. We experimentally evaluated the permeability to movement of different forest-cover types for the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), a neotropical migratory species breeding in mature deciduous or mixed forest. We compared homing time and movement patterns of 60 radio-tracked males translocated over 500 m and released in untreated or partially harvested mature deciduous stands, as well as in conifer plantations, in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Although there was no strong effect of forest-cover type on homing time, path tortuosity, or travel speed, individuals released in conifer plantations tended to move faster and straighter than those released within untreated forest. Considering that translocated Ovenbirds have been shown to be less likely to return to capture sites in landscapes dominated by conifer plantations, our results suggest that they minimize time spent in inhospitable cover types. Responses to conifer plantation edges and similar interfaces may thus represent decisive components of time-based functional connectivity estimates. Hence, it appears that not all forest-cover types offer an equal resistance to Ovenbird movements and, consequently, a dichotomic habitat/non-habitat view may be too simplistic when assessing or modeling landscape permeability for passerine birds.
